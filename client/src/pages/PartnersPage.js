We do consider purely jurisprudential or historical pieces on a case-by-case basis. Despite being a journal run by students of English law, we do not evince a preference for submissions relating to English law; our most important criteria for publication is that your submission relates to a contemporary legal issue and provides critical insight into the area of law you have chosen.</p>
